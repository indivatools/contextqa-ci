# ContextQA for CI/CD

Run your [ContextQA](https://contextqa.com) test plans from any CI/CD pipeline. Every push or pull request
triggers the plan, waits for the result, publishes it to your CI's test report, and fails the build unless
the run passed.

| Your CI | Integration | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Actions | `uses: indivatools/contextqa-ci@v1` | [below](#github-actions) |
| GitLab CI/CD | CI/CD Catalog component | [providers/gitlab](providers/gitlab) |
| Jenkins | shared library step `contextqaRunPlan` | [providers/jenkins](providers/jenkins) |
| Azure Pipelines | `ContextQARunTestPlan@1` task | [providers/azure-devops](providers/azure-devops) |
| CircleCI | `contextqa/run-test-plan` orb | [providers/circleci](providers/circleci) |
| Bitbucket Pipelines | pipe | [providers/bitbucket](providers/bitbucket) |
| Anything else | `contextqa` CLI or container image | [below](#any-other-ci) |

All of them run the same engine, so behaviour, options and exit codes are identical everywhere.

## Before you start

You need two things from ContextQA:

1. **The test plan ID.** Open the plan in ContextQA; the ID is the number in the URL
   (`…/plans/827/…` → `827`). The plan's **CI/CD** tab also generates a ready-made snippet for your provider.
2. **An API token.** Create one under **Settings › API tokens** (or from the plan's **CI/CD** tab) with these
   permissions:

   | Permission | Needed for |
   |---|---|
   | `TEST_PLAN_EXECUTE` | starting the run, and uploading a mobile build (required) |
   | `TEST_PLAN_RESULTS_READ` | waiting for the result (required) |
   | `TEST_CASE_RESULTS_READ` | per-test results in your CI's test report (recommended) |

   Store it as a secret in your CI, named `CONTEXTQA_TOKEN`. Never commit it to the repository.

## GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: ContextQA

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  contextqa:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: indivatools/contextqa-ci@v1
        with:
          plan-id: 827
          token: ${{ secrets.CONTEXTQA_TOKEN }}
```

Add `CONTEXTQA_TOKEN` under **Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions**. On every run you get:

- the job failing unless the test plan passed,
- a summary on the run page with counts, a link to the full ContextQA report, and each failing test case
  linked to its trace,
- an annotation for every failing test case,
- outputs for later steps: `run-id`, `report-url`, `result`, `passed`, `total-count`, `passed-count`,
  `failed-count`.

<details>
<summary>All inputs</summary>

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `plan-id` | required | Test plan to run. |
| `token` | required | API token, from a secret. |
| `environment` | the plan's own | Run against this ContextQA environment instead. |
| `android-build` | | Android build to test: a path in the workspace (uploaded) or an `https://` URL. |
| `ios-build` | | iOS build to test: a path in the workspace (uploaded) or an `https://` URL. |
| `timeout` | `3600` | Seconds to wait for the run before failing. |
| `poll-interval` | `15` | Seconds between status checks. |
| `wait` | `true` | `false` starts the run and moves on without waiting. |
| `fail-on` | `failure` | `never` reports the result without failing the job. |
| `junit-path` | | Also write JUnit XML to this path. |
| `api-url` | `https://server.contextqa.com` | Change only for a dedicated or on-premises ContextQA. |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Testing a mobile build produced earlier in the workflow</summary>

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
      - uses: indivatools/contextqa-ci@v1
        with:
          plan-id: 827
          token: ${{ secrets.CONTEXTQA_TOKEN }}
          android-build: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

The build is uploaded straight to your ContextQA workspace; no cloud storage credentials are needed in the
pipeline.

</details>

## Any other CI

Anything that can run Node.js 20+ or a container works:

```sh
# Node.js
CONTEXTQA_TOKEN=… npx @contextqa/cli@1 run-plan --plan-id 827 --junit reports/contextqa.xml

# Container
docker run --rm -e CONTEXTQA_TOKEN -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work \
  ghcr.io/indivatools/contextqa-cli:1 run-plan --plan-id 827 --junit reports/contextqa.xml
```

Every option is available as a flag or a `CONTEXTQA_*` environment variable (`contextqa --help` lists them).
The token is read from `CONTEXTQA_TOKEN` only, never from a flag, so it does not appear in process listings
or logs.

## Results and exit codes

The build passes only when the test plan's result is **SUCCESS**. A run that is aborted or stopped is not a
pass, even if no test case failed.

| Exit code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | The run passed. | |
| `1` | The run finished but did not pass. | Open the report link printed in the log. |
| `2` | Configuration or token problem. | Check the plan ID, the token and its permissions. Retrying will not help. |
| `3` | ContextQA could not be reached, or the run did not finish within the timeout. | The log links the run, which keeps going in ContextQA. Retry, or raise the timeout. |

Results are also written as JUnit XML, so GitLab, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and Bitbucket show each
test case in their own test report.

## Troubleshooting

| Message | Cause |
|---|---|
| `ContextQA token is missing` | The `CONTEXTQA_TOKEN` secret is not set, or not passed to the step. |
| `refused the token (HTTP 401)` | The token is wrong, expired or revoked. Create a new one. |
| `refused the token (HTTP 403)` | The token lacks a permission listed in [Before you start](#before-you-start), or the runner's IP is outside the token's allowlist. |
| `not found (HTTP 404)` | The `api-url` is wrong, or the plan ID does not exist in the token's workspace. |
| `Per-test results unavailable` | The token lacks `TEST_CASE_RESULTS_READ`. The verdict is unaffected; only per-test detail is missing. |
| `did not finish within 3600s` | The plan takes longer than the timeout. Raise `timeout`, and your CI's own job timeout above it. |

## Security

- The token is masked in logs on every supported CI and is only ever sent to your ContextQA API.
- Mobile builds are uploaded through a short-lived signed URL scoped to your workspace; the URL is never logged.
- The GitHub Action and the container image are built from this repository and published by its release
  workflow. Pin a full version (`@v1.2.3`, `:1.2.3`) if your policy requires immutable references.

## Versioning

`@v1`, `:1` and `@1` always point to the latest 1.x release. Changes that would break an existing pipeline
(removed inputs, changed exit codes) only ship in a new major version. Release notes are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/indivatools/contextqa-ci/releases).
