# ContextQA for CircleCI

An orb that runs a ContextQA test plan and fails the job unless it passes. Results are stored as JUnit, so
failing test cases show on the job's **Tests** tab.

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  contextqa: contextqa/run-test-plan@1   # namespace TBD
workflows:
  test:
    jobs:
      - contextqa/run:
          plan-id: '827'
          context: contextqa             # holds CONTEXTQA_TOKEN
```

1. Put `CONTEXTQA_TOKEN` in a [context](https://circleci.com/docs/contexts/) (or a project environment
   variable). Use an API token with `TEST_PLAN_EXECUTE` and `TEST_PLAN_RESULTS_READ`, plus
   `TEST_PLAN_BUILD_UPLOAD` to upload builds and `TEST_CASE_RESULTS_READ` for per-test results.
2. Allow third-party orbs in **Organization Settings › Security** if your organization restricts them.

To test a build from an earlier job, persist it to the workspace and pass `workspace-root` and
`android-build` / `ios-build`; see the `upload-a-build` example in [`orb.yml`](orb.yml).

The `contextqa/run-plan` command works inside your own jobs too, on any executor with Node.

## How it runs

The `run` job uses `cimg/node` and starts the CLI with `npx @contextqa/cli@1`. The test step records the
CLI's exit code instead of failing, so `store_test_results` always runs; a final step then fails the job
with that code.
